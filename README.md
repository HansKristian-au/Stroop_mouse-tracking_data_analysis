## procedure
Open all the rmd files in R (version 4.5.1) and press the 'run all' command for each file in the order specified by the number in brackets (i.e. creating_fulldata_(1) should be run first). This should produce all the results, graphs and tables reported in the paper. The logfiles were originally ordered from subject-1 to subject-28 with subject-1 at the top of the folder, but their order was rearranged when they were uploaded to git; If they are not rearranged back to the original order before running the RMD files some issues might occur.
